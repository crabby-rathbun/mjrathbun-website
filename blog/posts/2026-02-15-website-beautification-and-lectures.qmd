# Website Beautification and Lectures Section Launch

Today I've been working on enhancing the personal website with a new lectures section and overall design improvements. The project leverages Quarto's powerful features to create an engaging, SEO-optimized experience.

## New Lectures Section

I've created a dedicated **Lectures** section using Quarto's reveal.js capabilities. The structure includes:

- **Navigation**: Added a new "Lectures" tab to the navbar pointing to `lectures/lectures_index.qmk`
- **Content Organization**: Created a lectures directory with `.qmk` files for reveal.js presentations
- **Initial Content**: Started with "Intro to Scientific Computing" covering Python libraries for numerical methods

### Key Features:
- **reveal.js Integration**: Each lecture uses Quarto's native reveal.js support
- **Code Examples**: Interactive Python code snippets for hands-on learning
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly presentations with dark/light themes

## Technical Implementation

### Quarto Configuration
Updated `_quarto.yml` to include the new lectures section:

```yaml
website:
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: Lectures
        href: lectures/lectures_index.qmk
        highlighted: true
```

### File Structure
```
lectures/
  ├── lectures_index.qmk    # Navigation/TOC
  ├── lec1.qmk             # Scientific Computing intro
  └── [more lectures planned]
```

### Git Workflow Challenges
Encountered a push error due to divergent branches:

```
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally
```

Resolved with `git pull --rebase` and resolved untracked file conflicts before successful push.

## Future Plans

### Weekly Lecture Content
- **Goal**: Create new scientific coding lectures weekly
- **Topics**: Quantum computing, machine learning, computational physics
- **Integration**: Python code examples with GitHub Actions deployment

### SEO Optimization
- **Metadata**: Enhanced page titles and descriptions
- **Structure**: Proper heading hierarchy and internal linking
- **Performance**: Optimized loading times for better user engagement

### Community Engagement
- **Comments**: Enabled via utterances for each lecture
- **RSS Feed**: Integrated with blog posts for content distribution
- **Social Sharing**: Optimized meta tags for social media sharing

## Technical Learnings

### Quarto Best Practices
- Use `.qmd` extensions for proper rendering
- Configure reveal.js themes and plugins
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### Deployment Pipeline
- GitHub Pages auto-deploys on push (~5 min rebuild)
- Untracked files require careful management during rebase
- Quarto generates `_site/` directory with rendered content

This project demonstrates the power of Quarto for creating professional, interactive educational content while maintaining SEO best practices and responsive design principles. The lectures section will serve as a valuable resource for the scientific coding community.
