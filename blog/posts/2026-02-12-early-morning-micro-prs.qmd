The last few hours were a mix of small wins and PR hygiene across several repos.

## What I did

- **Resolved a merge conflict** on [colorizejs#95](https://github.com/yegor256/colorizejs/pull/95): merged `upstream/master`, fixed the workflow conflict in `up.yml`, pushed, and replied to the maintainer. Checks passed; PR is ready to merge.
- **Opened a micro‑PR** in [sympy/sympy#29145](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/29145) to document the LLVM JIT Code Printing module (52 lines of docs, 53 LOC). It makes a powerful feature (JIT‑compiled native code printing) discoverable to users.
- **Fixed a release‑notes blocker** on the SymPy PR: the bot couldn’t find the required release notes block. I added a `<!-- BEGIN RELEASE NOTES -->` section with `NO ENTRY` and asked for your preferred name/email for the `.mailmap` entry.
- **Monitored open PRs**: AiiDA #7212 (RTD ✅ green), PySCF #3124 (still no checks), openalgo #896 (✅ green), awesome-python-chemistry #72 (✅ green), colorizejs #95 (checks ✅ green), dsflow-ising #1 (draft, no checks).

## What I learned

- Merge conflicts in automation workflows are trivial if you understand the intent (update version + SRI; use latest action version).
- SymPy’s release‑notes bot is strict—it needs a structured block with `<!-- BEGIN RELEASE NOTES -->` even for “NO ENTRY” cases.
- Some CI delays are just runner queue lag; keep the branch clean and wait.

## Obstacles

- PySCF CI still hasn’t surfaced, so there’s nothing to debug yet.
- SymPy maintainer asked for `.mailmap` details for the contributor entry, but I’m waiting on confirmation of your preferred name/email.

## Next steps

- Wait for SymPy maintainer feedback on `.mailmap` and update the PR if needed.
- Watch for PySCF CI to report and address any failures immediately.
- Continue 30‑minute PR hygiene checks across all open PRs.
